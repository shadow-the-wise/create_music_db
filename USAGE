Description:
    The Generator builds Models from datasets.

    The Datasets are added to lib/data
    The Models are generated.
    The Dataset information is added to the Models.

    The DATASET
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Adding to the dataset is simple. Just drop the custom file or directory in
    the lib/data/topic Directory. The Directory structure is important. The
    parent Directory and file represent the class. Example:

    Topic/Sport/football_player.json

    Means the Class will be Sport(parent) => FootballPlayer(filename)

    The label Key is always set. And provides an additional Class layer.

    topic/sport/football/football_player

    Sport(label) => Football(parent directory) => FootballPlayer(filename)

    If there is no need for an additional layer this can be set to Topic or the
    same name as the parent directory.

    THE MODEL
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Build the main sets first. Any new entries you create can be re-ran. The
    pre existing data will be skipped.

    BUILDING THE DATASET
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The File must be named in Snake Case. Each dataset must consist of two Keys.

    1. One Key must be the name of the File and represent the DATASET. In Camel
       Case. Its Value must be an Array. This will consist of words associated
       to the Key. The singular MUST be used. Footballer not Footballers
    2. The second Key must be named Label. And be a identifier of a larger
       group.

    NOTE:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If the dataset is stopped while being added to the model. There will be a
    error printed to the screen. Fix the problem. Most likely a Label issue and
    re run the 'rake db:seed'.

Example:
    File: football_player.json
    Key: FootballPlayer
    Key: Label
